1. Overview: 1 paragraph that describes your system. State the system's name and why it's called so, as well as the main components of the system and the algorithms behind them.

2. Setup: Step-by-step instructions for how to run your code, including any dependencies, versions, and so on.

3. System Architecture: A more detailed account of your system (at least 4 paragraphs) and its components. You should clearly describe what components of script generation that you chose to focus on (e.g., agent personality modeling, dialogue generation, narrative prose generation, suspense modeling, conflict modeling, musical lyric generation, humor and sarcasm modeling, visual animation, computational cinematographyâ€¦), citing scholarly work as appropriate. Include a block diagram of your system architecture.

4. Computational Creativity: You should follow the general SPECS procedure to evaluate your system. Start by stating your assumptions and definitions for what it means for a system to be creative here. These statements should be founded on prior work (i.e., you should be citing respected scholars in the field). Next, clearly state at least one creativity metric for your system and evaluate it based on that metric. This metric can be derived from the SPECS themes, Ritchie's criteria, the Four PPPPerspectives, or another formalized evaluation procedure from scholarly work (e.g. Colton's Creative Tripod). Regardless of the metric and definitions you specify, you must acknowledge any limitations, biases, or potential issues with your evaluation. Your grade will not be affected if your data is biased or limited unless you leave out this information.

5. Personal Challenges: Describe how you personally challenged yourself on this assignment as a computer scientist. How did you strive to make your system unique, meaningful, and use sophisticated techniques? How did you push yourself as a scholar and a programmer? What new techniques did you try? What discoveries and connections did you make?
