Final Project for Computational Creativity Fall 2018.

System names: personalixca

1. Overview: 
	My system is called _personalixca_ in reference to the MEXICA system that inspired how the narrative is crafted and one of the features that I focused on: personality modeling.  Script writing is an intensely complicatd problem and I made some simplifying assumptions in order to make the problem more manageable.  Thus, the scripts are represented as a simple sequence of actions taken by the characters.  The script generation process has three main components represented by different modules:  character.py, narrator.py, and action.py.  In general, the narrator module keeps track of the locations and characters in the narrative and uses the character module (which draws on the action module) to add actions to the narrative.  I focused on trying to model character personalities and social connections between characters, so for simplicity there are only two actions that involve an interaction between one character and other (one negative and one positive interaction).  Overall, this system does not produce particularly interesting artifacts, but is a solid base for expansion in future work. 

2. Setup:
	1. To generate a script, run the `python3 narrator.py` command.
		- the script is written as a .txt file into the results folder.
	2. The character and setting names can be chanced by modifying the cleaned_names and cleaned_locations files in the knowledge folder.

3. 
	I ended up focusing on two areas for the script generation.  First, I chose to focus on modeling character personality.  Each character is assigned a personality class object that represents a 2D space for personality.  Drawing from Edirlei Soares de Lima, Bruno Feijo, and Antonio L. Furtado's paper "Player behavior and personality modeling for interactive storytelling in games," I decided to represent each personality trait in the range [-1, 1]. But, instead of using the "Big Five" for my dimensions like these authors suggested, I decided to use two dimension for simplicity.  Inspired by the personality dimension system used in the BOC for conversations about styles of leadership and group participation (and also DnD), I decided that one dimension of the personality ratings would be a scale of good to evil and the second would be a scale from lawful to chaotic.  Good and lawful were considered the positive traits and evil and chaotic are negative traits on each scale respectively; more negative traits are represented by increasingly negative values along each dimension and increasing positive values represent the positive traits on each dimension.  In my system, the personality dimensions are used in conjunction with the social connections between characters to inform what kind of actions the characters will make.  Unlike the "Player behavior..." paper, I used the dimensional representation of of personality to inform how characters in the script acted instead of modeling demonstrated behavior.  An interesting opportunity for future work would be to both allow character personalities to be flexible (to change in response to demonstrated actions) and to use more dimensions to represent personality.  

	The second area that I focused on was modeling social connections.  I modeled the social connections between characters in a way inspired by the MEXICA system.  The MEXICA system used four dimenstions to quantify character relationships including a scale from brotherly love to brotherly hate, lover's love to lover's hate, gratefulness and ingratitude, and admiration and disdain.  These four dimensions were each rated on an integer scale from [-3, 3] where positive values were associated with the positive side of the dimension and increasingly negative values represented the more negative side of the dimension. The social connection modeling informed what actions characters would take and how the scripts are evaluated.  First, whether a character had positive or negative connections to another character would determine whether they could possibly take a positive or negative action against this character.  Thus, both character personality and the social connection between one character and other will determine if a character will act positively or negatively towards another character.  The social connetion modeling also has a dynamic element: when a character makes a positive or negative act against another character, it will modify the social connection between the character being acted upon and the character making the act (it is worth noting that the connections between characters are not symmetrical).  Second, the fitness of a given script is measured by the total change in the connection parameters between all the characters in the narrative.  For instance, if the connections between _character_1_ and _character_2_ was [3, 3, 3, 3] at the beginning of the narrative and [2, 2, 2, 2] at the end (each of these  numbers represents a dimension of the connection), then the total change of this connection is 4.  Overall, the social connection modeling contributes to determining which actions characters will take and how scripts are evalutated.

	I will now detail the general process for generating a script.  There are two sources of knowledge for my system: a names file and a locations file.  These two sources are used to initialize the names of characters and places by the narrator.  When characters are initialized, they are placed in a random location out of the locations currently included in the narrative.  The narrator then chooses a location to begin the narrative in (one that has at least one character).  The narrator then prompts a character in the current location who is able to take an action to choose an action to take.  If there are no such characters, then the narrator will switch the focus of the story to another location where there are characters who can take an action.  If there are no such options, then the narrative is ended.  When a character is prompted to take an action by the narrator, the character builds an Actions object based on the current state of the world, including their location, which other characters are in their location, and the social connections between the characters.  When the Actions object is initialized, an object for each possible action is instantiated with the narrative state and added to a list of possible actions in the Actions object.  Each action has a conditional instance variable that expresses whether the character instantiating the Actions object is able to take this particular action.  Giving actions pre-conditions like this is inspired by the pre/post-conditions used in the MEXICA system.  Once the Actions object has been instantiated, a character will choose an action randomly out of the actions that they can take (i.e. the actions where the conditions for taking that actions are met).  As previously mentioned, personality and social connections between characters inform the action conditions.  Character health is another action condition.  After a character chooses an action, the character will return a string representation of this action to the narrator who then adds this action to the events of the narrative with the time that the action took place.  The narrator will then find another character to make an action, repeating the process again.  The narrator will continue this process until a set number of actions have been addded, until all characters have died, or until it is not possible for any characters to act.  

	The narratives generated by the narrator are organized into episodes (I was intending to build the system such that the same narrator created multiple episodes that would make up a season of scripts, but time became a limiting factor).  Once the narrative for an episode is completed, it is added to a list of episodes that are then evalutated.  The final product of the system is the episode with the highest score assigned to its script.  As discussed above, the change in the social connection values between characters is used as a hueristic for the quality of the script.  This simple measure attempts to capture how dramatic the script is--the more that the connection between characters changes, then the more actions that have been taken that change character relationships, which suggests that interesting events have occured.  Valuing this kind of narrative is somewhat Aristotelian, but it is intuitive that events that change characters opinions of each other lend to creating interesting narratives.  This project leaves essentially infinite opportunities for future work and adding to the evaluation step is certainly one of them.  It would be interesting  to value other narrative elements like suspense or more obviously the standard rising action, climax, and conclusion structure that is standard in narratives.  These steps would be parralel a much needed expansion of the actions available to characters.  Additionally, if the seasons structure was added, evalutations could be made on both the episodic level as the season is being constructed and at the season-ic level.  Overall, this system gives a somewhat interesting base for building narrative structures, allowing for future work to tackle some of the other elements of script building.

	I will first state a definition of creativity based on the process metric of the PPPPerspectives and I will then evaluate my system for creativity based on this metric.  First, it is clear that this system is more of a scientific experiemnt than a polished CC system.  As such, I will focus on the process metric of the PPPPerspectives since I exclusively was focused on the generative process throughout creating this system.  The process metric asks four major questions.  I choose this metric because the question whether the systems are attempting to model human creativity or whether they are attempting to be creative based on the merit of its own process is interesting in the context of my system.  First, it is important to consider how the system works within a conceptual space to produce its artifacts.  Second, there is a question of whether the system builds artifacts with a process at least as complex a process as a generation-evaluation loop.  Third is a question about if the system separates the inspiration, planning, and creation processes.  Fourth, is a question about how much of the system's behavior is determined by the programmer creating the system--how autonomous is the system?  So, how does this system meet these criteria?

	This system somehwat meets some of these criteria and blantantly fails others.  Firstly, it is important to note that this system does not attempt to model human creativity to create its artifacts.  The process of creating a narrative is more similar to how people generally think of videogames--there are multiple agents with different characteristics acting and moving around in a world based on a set of pre-defined rules.  Whether my implementation of this process is creative depends on the four questions mentioned above.  First, my systems conceptual space is seriously limited and relies heavily on randomly instantiated characters and locations.  While the names of the characters and places are drawn from a knowledge base, the actions that the characters take are determined by rules that are built into the system.  This is related to the fourth question of the process criteria.  In terms of the fourth question, it is fair to say that the majority of the decision making intelligence is baked into the system by the programmer.  If the system used inspiration to create the actions, then the system would have more autonomy and would more satifying fulfill this requirement.  While on the topic of inspiration, it is worth mentioning that this system does not have separate inspiration, planning, and creation steps and simply creates an artifact in one go.  Lastly, this system does have an evaluation step as mentioned in the second quesion, but it is not transformative.  Overall, this system is not particularly creative, but it does provide a base for expansion into to a more interesting and creative CC system.  Adding inspiration processes and expanding the generation of scripts to include elements from inspiration would bring this system much closer to being creative under the process metric of the PPPPerspectives which provides a good model for how to make this system more creative in future work.

	This was an extremely tough project for me to feel succesful in.  Trying to balance creating an interesting system while not being overly ambitious was extremely hard.  I ended up deleting some modules representing ideas that I didn't have time to work on or realized would introduce too much complexity.  My choices for system design were heavily influenced by the two papers mentioned in the system architecture section--the process of looking into ideas from literature to inspire how I would approach a problem has been new to me in this class.  The process of being pretty stumped and unsure about how to aproach a problem and then reading about other approaches for inspiration has been something that I have enjoyed in this class.  It is somewhat empowering to know that at the very least, for most problems in computer science, I can go spend 4-5+ hours reading papers and then have a somewhat reasonable idea of how to approach it.  This realization has been a major take away from this project and also this class in general.  I did not really use any computer science techniques that were new to me and this leads me to the strange part of this project.  I did try to model two different interesting parts of narrative--character personality and social connections between characters--but I didn't push the system far enough to take these ideas and put them in something I can confidently say is creative.  I think that if I added some additional systems on top of what I made including inspiration and a step after the narrative construction that turns the narrative into a more convincing script, then the system would have more merit.  Thus, at this point I have ended up feeling like I spent a lot of time thinking about and creating a system that is more of a base for making an intesting and creative system than being a creative system itself.
